# What is Spring?

> The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform
> -- Wikipedia [^1]

[^1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework

---

# Yes - but what is Spring?

Core spring is based on the ideas of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) - so we'll start there.

---

## Dependency Injection (DI)

A class is provided with the services etc that it needs rather than creating them.

## Inversion of Control (IoC) - in Spring

IoC is a very open design principle - but in Spring terms it mostly refers to the spring container that provide the actual DI mechanics (creation of beans, injecting them following configuration etc).

---

# IoC and DI applications

---

# Initial code

We start with a simple application [^2]

[^2]: initial/pom.xml

---

## Services

* Calculator
* Display

---

## Business Logic

The calculation class performs a business operation using the services.

However - let's take a look at the code:

---

### Main method in the Business Logic

```java
  public void complexCalculation() {
    // Service 1
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

    int result = calculator.plus(2, 3);

    // Service 2
    Display display = new Display();

    display.output(String.format("2 + 3 = %d", result));  
  }
```

---

## Problems

* How do we test different implementations of either service?
* How do we even provide different implementations?

All of these require editing the business logic class.

---

# Dependency Injection

Let's take a look at how we can manually change this over to a DI based setup.

First round - manual DI - no spring [^3]

[^3]: initial-manual/pom.xml

---

## Constructor vs Setter

We can do this in two ways:

Provide (inject) the required services (dependencies) via:

* the constructor
* setters

---

## Setter injection

```java
  private Calculator calculator;
  private Display display;

  public void setCalculator(Calculator calculator) {
    this.calculator = calculator;
  }

  public void setDisplay(Display display) {
    this.display = display;
  }  
```

---

## Constructor injection

```java
  private final Calculator calculator;
  private final Display display;

  public CalculationConstructorInjection(Calculator calculator,
    Display display) {
    this.calculator = calculator;
    this.display = display;
  }
```

---

## Orchestration

OK - but how do we set up (or orchestrate)  the application?

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Services 
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    Display display = new Display();

    // Setter injection
    CalculationSetterInjection calculationSetterInjection = new CalculationSetterInjection();
    calculationSetterInjection.setCalculator(calculator);
    calculationSetterInjection.setDisplay(display);

    calculationSetterInjection.complexCalculation();

    // Constructor injection
    CalculationConstructorInjection calculationConstructorInjection =
      new CalculationConstructorInjection(calculator, display);

    calculationConstructorInjection.complexCalculation();
  }
```

---

# Spring?

So far we have seen DI but had to orchestrate the application by hand.

Spring provides an IoC container - objects define what they need and the IoC container can then provide the required dependencies via DI.

We'll look at three ways:

* Old style (spring - with XML configured beans)
* Annotation style (spring - with annotated classes)
* Spring Boot

---

## Spring Beans

A spring bean is any object that is managed by the Spring IoC container.

A spring bean is usually a singleton (this is the default bean scope - we will look at scopes later on).

---

# Spring - XML

First steps are to grab some java libraries [^4]

We'll be using spring's context and beans.

[^4]: initial-spring/xml/pom.xml

---

## Application context

Spring provides a set of classes (based around BeanFactory) that allows us to configure the IoC container.

However - in nearly every project it is far far more common to use spring's application context for this.

---

## applicationContext.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <bean id="display" class="no.itera.spring.Display"/>
  <bean id="calculator" class="no.itera.spring.Calculator"/>

  <bean id="calculationConstructorInjection" class="no.itera.spring.CalculationConstructorInjection">
    <constructor-arg name="calculator" ref="calculator"/>
    <constructor-arg name="display" ref="display"/>
  </bean>

  <bean id="calculationSetterInjection" class="no.itera.spring.CalculationSetterInjection">
    <property name="calculator" ref="calculator"/>
    <property name="display" ref="display"/>
  </bean>
</beans>
```

---

## Using the context

```java
    // Load the context
    ApplicationContext context =
      new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");

    // Get a bean by type
    CalculationSetterInjection calculationSetterInjection =
      context.getBean(CalculationSetterInjection.class);
    
    calculationSetterInjection.complexCalculation();

    // Get a bean by name
    CalculationConstructorInjection calculationConstructorInjection =
        (CalculationConstructorInjection) context.getBean("calculationConstructorInjection");
    calculationConstructorInjection.complexCalculation();
```

---

## Problems

This works - but - it means that the XML file is tightly coupled to the class structures.

If we change the java code we have to remember to adjust this file.

---

# Spring - Annotations

Let's modify the previous version using spring's component scanning mechanism (annotations) [^5]

[^5]: initial-spring/annotations/pom.xml

---

## Application context

The context file becomes a lot smaller - it simply configures what packages to scan

---

## applicationContext.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

  <context:annotation-config/>
  <context:component-scan base-package="no.itera.spring"/>
</beans>
```

---

## Annotating classes

Classes get a class level annotation stating what sort of bean they are (@Service, @Component, @Repository etc)

Injection points are often marked @Autowired [^6]

[^6]: From Spring 4.3 a spring bean class with only one constructor does not need the autowired annotation - spring will wire it

---

## Using the context

The code in Application is exactly the same as for the XML version

---

## Notes

These examples are very simple. some other things we need to consider are

* bean scopes (is it a singleton? etc)
* qualifiers (requiring a bean and there are multiple implementations available)

## Problems

* Still a lot of boiler plate
* Managing dependencies in a larger project is still challenging
  
---

# Spring Boot

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
> We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
-- Spring.io [^7]

[^7]: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/

---

Spring Boot tries to simplify:

* Setup
* Dependency Management
* Configuration

---

## Spring Boot Starters

Spring Boot provides different starters - so that you can add support for different functionality.

We'll take a look at what's available after we've looked at the same test app in a Spring Boot version.[^8]

[^8]: initial-spring-boot/pom.xml

---

## Spring Boot Application

* Classes keep the same annotations as before
* Main class gets annotated `@SpringBootApplication`
* We will implement the CommandLineRunner as it is a command line app

---

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class  Application implements CommandLineRunner {
  private final ApplicationContext context;

  public Application(ApplicationContext context) {
    this.context = context;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }

  @Override
  public void run(String... args) {
    CalculationSetterInjection calculationSetterInjection =
      context.getBean(CalculationSetterInjection.class);
    
    calculationSetterInjection.complexCalculation();

    CalculationConstructorInjection calculationConstructorInjection =
      context.getBean(CalculationConstructorInjection.class);
    
    calculationConstructorInjection.complexCalculation();
  }
}
```

---

## Spring Initializr

Under the Add Dependencies button you can see what starter packs you can add.

---

# Common context issues

---

Spring complains if it cannot build a valid context

Usually it will be one of two issues:

* Cannot find a bean it needs
* Finds more than one match

---

## How to fix

First - dig down through the stack trace - spring will try and tell you what it didn't manage to do.

Things to remember:

* Missing annotation on a @Component or @Service or similar?
* Missing configuration or auto configuration?
* Search by type (interface) or name can give more than one hit - can you use @Qualifier?
* Component scanning also scans dependencies (if the package name is correct)
  * did you get more than you bargained for?
  * did something that was included expect certain dependencies that are not available?
  


---

# More on Spring Beans

Spring beans have a scope which defines lifecycle

* singleton (default)
* prototype

Spring web-aware only

* request
* session
* application
* websocket

---

## Singleton bean

The standard spring bean.

The spring container will always return the same bean.

## Prototype bean

The spring container will return a new instance every time.

---

## Web aware

Lifetime of web aware beans

* request - single http request
* session - http session
* websocket - a websocket
* application - servlet context

---

# Spring Boot Configuration

* Property Files
* Yaml files
* Profiles

---

## Defining property file location

```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:somefile.properties")
public class SomeConfiguration {}
```

---

## One or more files

```java
// Single
@PropertySource("classpath:somefile.properties")

// Multiple - java 8 and above
@PropertySource("classpath:somefile.properties")
@PropertySource("classpath:anotherfile.properties")

// Multiple - any java version
@PropertySources({
  @PropertySource("classpath:somefile.properties")
  @PropertySource("classpath:anotherfile.properties")
})
```

For multiple files - if a name collision occurs then the _last_ file read wins.

---

## Using property values

Simplest with @Value injection

```java
@Value( "${config.property.name}" )
private String configProperty;
```

You can inject Environment and use that:

```java
@Autowired
private Environment env;

env.getProperty("config.property.name");
```

---

## ConfigurationProperties

```java
@Configuration // spring boot before 2.1 needs this in addition
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "db")
public class SomeConfig {
  private String username;
  private String password;
}
```

This will read properties db.username and db.password

It is a standard java bean - so you must define setters and getters (or use lombok or a kotlin data class)

You can nest configuration classes and build out a property hierarchy.

---

## File names/types/profiles

* application.properties
* application-profileName.properties
* properties vs yaml

application*.properties/yaml are handled by default - you do not need to specify a location - just inject @Value and you're done.

---

### Profiles

We can specify at runtime what profiles are active.

Spring boot will load application-profileName.* only if profile with name profileName is active.

---


### Properties vs YAML

Yaml can be used and is often useful for properties that are nested in nature.

Yaml does _not_ work with PropertySource - but works fine with ConfigurationProperty and default property (application*) loading.

---

# Spring Boot MVC

* Resources
* Requests/sessions
* Responses

Add the web starter:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

## Resources

### Get all items

```java
@RestController
public class ExampleController {
    private final SomeService service;

    public ExampleController(SomeService service) {
      this.service = service;
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    @ResponseBody
    public List<Example> getAllExamples() {
        return service.examples();
    }
}
```

---

### PathVariable

`GET /3`

```java
@GetMapping("/{id}")
@ResponseBody
public Example getExample(@PathVariable Integer id) {
    return service.example(id);
}
```

---

### RequestParam

`GET /?id=3`

```java
@GetMapping("/")
@ResponseBody
public Example getExample(@RequestParam Integer id) {
    return service.example(id);
}
```

RequestParam can also retrieve from form posts and file uploads

---

### RequestBody

```java
@PostMapping("/")
@ResponseBody
public Example addExample(@RequestBody Example example) {
    return service.addExample(example);
}
```

---

## Example

Let's take a look at an example project.[^9]

This time in kotlin with gradle using the kotlin DSL - just for fun.

Initially created with spring initializer by choosing kotlin and gradle on https://start.spring.io/

# Spring Web vs Spring Reactive Web

Spring web uses traditional synchronous coding - and for client calls uses classes like RestTemplate.

Spring Reactive Web brings asynchronous calling - and uses WebClient for client calls.

We'll build a simple echo server to investigate [^10]

[^10]: spring-webclient-example

---

## Handler

Takes a request and returns some response

```java
@Component
public class EchoHandler {
  public Mono<ServerResponse> echo(ServerRequest request) {
    return ServerResponse
        .ok()
        .contentType(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
        .body(BodyInserters.fromValue(request.queryParam("val").orElse("No value")));
  }
}
```

---

## Routing

Route a url to a handler

```java
@Configuration
public class EchoRouter {
  @Bean
  public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route(EchoHandler handler) {
    return RouterFunctions
        .route(RequestPredicates.GET("/echo")
            .and(RequestPredicates.accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)), handler::echo);
  }
}
```

---

## Testing the router/handler

Test class that uses SpringExtension to run.

Add a spring boot test annotation asking for a random port - this will put a WebTestClient object into the spring context.

```java
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class EchoRouterTest {
  @Autowired
  private WebTestClient webTestClient;

  @Test
  void testEmptyEcho() {
    webTestClient
        .get().uri("/echo")
        .accept(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
        .exchange()
        .expectStatus().isOk()
        .expectBody(String.class).isEqualTo("No value");
  }
```

---

## Run and test

* http://localhost:8080/echo
* http://localhost:8080/echo?val="Echo"

Note that when we call these URLs - our entire code is asynchronous. It is spring itself that is handling synchronicity.

---

## WebClient

We'll add a call to a remote server to test this [^11]

Add a config param to application.properties for the echo server url:

```
echo.server.url=http://localhost:8000
```

[^11]: For testing - https://github.com/rpatterson/httpd-echo

---

## WebClient handler

Create a new handler and inject the configuration:

```java
@Component
public class RemoteEchoHandler {
  private final WebClient client;

  public RemoteEchoHandler(@Value("${echo.server.url}") String echoServerUrl) {
    this.client = WebClient.create(echoServerUrl);
  }

  ...
}
```

---

## Handler call

Use the client to run a simple get call passing on the val parameter from the request

```java
client.get().uri(uriBuilder -> uriBuilder
        .queryParam("val", request.queryParam("val").orElse("No value"))
        .build())
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono(String.class)
```

---

## Handler call

This can then be chained together with the response code

```java
public Mono<ServerResponse> echo(ServerRequest request) {
    return client.get().uri(uriBuilder -> uriBuilder
        .queryParam("val", request.queryParam("val").orElse("No value"))
        .build())
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono(String.class)
        .flatMap(body -> ServerResponse.ok().contentType(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN).body(BodyInserters.fromValue(body)));
  }
```

---

## Run and test

* http://localhost:8080/remoteEcho
* http://localhost:8080/remoteEcho?val="Echo"

Again - when we call these URLs - our code is asynchronous. It is spring itself that is handling synchronicity.


---

## Other reactive spring

Reactive spring is also often used with things like spring data - allowing the use of Mono and Flux to allow asynchronous calls from the database out through spring web to outermost layer where spring itself executes the code chain.

---

# Databases

* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Data JDBC

Starters:

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
		</dependency>
```

---

## Flyway

Database migration

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
			<artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
		</dependency>
```
---

## H2

In memory DB

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
		</dependency>
```

---

## Flyway migrations

Flyway will automatically apply migrations found under db/migration in the classpath

Migration files are SQL

E.g. `V1__create_demo_parent_table.sql`

```sql
CREATE TABLE demo_parent (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

---

## JPA Models

Spring data JPA uses standard javax.persistence annotations.

Annotated spring beans. Column names match to field names if not annotated.

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "demo_parent")
public class Parent {
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  Long id;

  String name;

  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  Set<Child> children;

  // constructors, getters, setters
}
```

---

## JPA repository

Spring data JPA provides a repository view with standard methods (get by ID etc)

```java
public interface ParentRepository extends JpaRepository<Parent, Long> {
}
```

---

### JPA repository methods

You can add methods to the interface (spring provides the implementation) where the method name is used to generate the underlying query:

```java
  List<Parent> findByName(String name);
```

You can also specify queries in JPQL or SQL

```java
// JPQL
@Query("SELECT c FROM cases c WHERE c.status = 1")
Collection<Case> findAllOpenCases();

// SQL
@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM cases c WHERE c.status = 1", nativeQuery = true)
Collection<Case> findAllOpenCases();
```

---

## Testing

Let's take a look at using the JPA repositories/models by looking at some `@DataJpaTest` integration tests.[^12]

[^12]: spring-boot-db-example - ParentRepositoryIT/ChildRepositoryIT

---

## JDBC Models

Spring data JDBC doesn't require domain beans - coding takes place using standard java.sql.* classes.

However - it is often useful to model the data as plain spring beans and provide a row mapper implementation.

```java
public class ItemRowMapper implements RowMapper<Item> {
  @Override
  public Item mapRow(ResultSet resultSet, int i) throws SQLException {
    Item item = new Item();

    item.setId(resultSet.getLong("id"));
    item.setName(resultSet.getString("name"));

    return item;
  }
}
```

---

### JDBC queries

We can inject a JdbcMapper and query the database (using a row mapper if we have created one)

```java
    String query = "SELECT * FROM demo_item WHERE id = ?";

    Item item = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(query, new ItemRowMapper(), itemId);
```

For example see the Spring JDBC integration test.[^13]
