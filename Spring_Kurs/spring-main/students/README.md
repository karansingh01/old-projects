# What is Spring?

> The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform
> -- Wikipedia [^1]

[^1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework

---

# Yes - but what is Spring?

Core spring is based on the ideas of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) - so we'll start there.

---

## Dependency Injection (DI)

A class is provided with the services etc that it needs rather than creating them.

## Inversion of Control (IoC) - in Spring

IoC is a very open design principle - but in Spring terms it mostly refers to the spring container that provide the actual DI mechanics (creation of beans, injecting them following configuration etc).

---

# IoC and DI applications

---

# Initial code

We start with a simple application [^2]

[^2]: ./exercises/exercise1/

---

## Services

* Calculator
* Display

---

### Calculator Service

```java
  public int plus(int a, int b);

  public int minus(int a, int b);

  public int multiply(int a, int b);

  public int divide(int a, int b);
```

---

### Display Service

```java
  public void output(String value);
```

---

## Business Logic

The calculation class performs a business operation using the services.

However - let's take a look at the code:

---

### Main method in the Business Logic

```java
  public void complexCalculation() {
    // Service 1
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

    int result = calculator.plus(2, 3);

    // Service 2
    Display display = new Display();

    display.output(String.format("2 + 3 = %d", result));  
  }
```

---

## Problems

* How do we test different implementations of either service?
* How do we even provide different implementations?

All of these require editing the business logic class.

---

# Dependency Injection

Let's take a look at how we can manually change this over to a DI based setup.

First round - manual DI - no spring.

---

## Constructor vs Setter

We can do this in two ways:

Provide (inject) the required services (dependencies) via:

* the constructor
* setters

---

## Setter injection

```java
  private Calculator calculator;
  private Display display;

  public void setCalculator(Calculator calculator) {
    this.calculator = calculator;
  }

  public void setDisplay(Display display) {
    this.display = display;
  }  
```

---

## Constructor injection

```java
  private final Calculator calculator;
  private final Display display;

  public Calculation(Calculator calculator, Display display) {
    this.calculator = calculator;
    this.display = display;
  }
```

---

## Orchestration

OK - but how do we set up (or orchestrate) the application?

---

## Orchestration - Setter injection

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Services 
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    Display display = new Display();

    // Setter injection
    Calculation calculation = new Calculation();
    calculation.setCalculator(calculator);
    calculation.setDisplay(display);

    // Business logic
    calculation.complexCalculation();
  }
```

---

## Orchestration - Constructor injection

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Services 
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    Display display = new Display();

    // Constructor injection
    Calculation calculation = new Calculation(calculator, display);

    // Business logic
    calculation.complexCalculation();
  }
```

---

## Exercise 1

* Convert the simple initial application to be constructor injected.

---

## Exercise 1 - Walkthrough

First round - manual DI - no spring [^3]

[^3]:  ./exercises/exercise1/

---

# Spring?

So far we have seen DI but had to orchestrate the application by hand.

Spring provides an IoC container - objects define what they need and the IoC container can then provide the required dependencies via DI.

We'll look at three ways:

* Old style (spring - with XML configured beans)
* Annotation style (spring - with annotated classes)
* Spring Boot

---

## Spring Beans

A spring bean is any object that is managed by the Spring IoC container.

A spring bean is usually a singleton (this is the default bean scope - we will look at scopes later on).

---

# Spring - XML

First steps are to grab some java libraries. We state our dependencies in the pom.xml file used by maven:

```xml
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
			<version>5.3.1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
			<version>5.3.1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-beans</artifactId>
			<version>5.3.1</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
```

---

## Application context

Spring provides a set of classes (based around BeanFactory) that allows us to configure the IoC container.

However - in nearly every project it is far far more common to use spring's application context for this.

---

## applicationContext.xml - setter injection

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <bean id="display" class="no.itera.spring.Display"/>
  <bean id="calculator" class="no.itera.spring.Calculator"/>

  <bean id="calculation" class="no.itera.spring.Calculation">
    <property name="calculator" ref="calculator"/>
    <property name="display" ref="display"/>
  </bean>
</beans>
```

---

## applicationContext.xml - constructor injection

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <bean id="display" class="no.itera.spring.Display"/>
  <bean id="calculator" class="no.itera.spring.Calculator"/>

  <bean id="calculation" class="no.itera.spring.Calculation">
    <constructor-arg name="calculator" ref="calculator"/>
    <constructor-arg name="display" ref="display"/>
  </bean>
</beans>
```

---

## Using the context

```java
    // Load the context
    ApplicationContext context =
      new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");

    // Get a bean by type
    Calculation calculation = context.getBean(Calculation.class);

    // Get a bean by name
    Calculation calculation =
        (Calculation) context.getBean("calculation");
```

---

## Exercise 2

* Complete the spring XML configuration for the application

Things to note - the Service classes are identical to those used in the previous exercise.

The only changes here are in how we orchestrate the app.

---

## Exercise 2 - Walkthrough

We'll be using spring's context and beans [^4]

[^4]:  ./exercises/exercise2/

--- 

## Problems

This works - but - it means that the XML file is tightly coupled to the class structures.

If we change the java code we have to remember to adjust this file.

---

# Spring - Annotations

Let's modify the previous version using spring's component scanning mechanism.

Scanning is enabled in the application context file.

It triggers spring to go through all classes in a given package tree looking for annotations.

---

## Application context

The context file becomes a lot smaller - it simply configures what packages to scan

---

## applicationContext.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

  <context:annotation-config/>
  <context:component-scan base-package="no.itera.spring"/>
</beans>
```

---

## Annotating classes

Classes get a class level annotation stating what sort of bean they are (@Service, @Component, @Repository)

Injection points are often marked @Autowired [^5]

```java
@Component
class ServiceName {
  ...  
}
```

[^5]: From Spring 4.3 a spring bean class with only one constructor does not need the autowired annotation - spring will wire it

---

## Using the context

The code in Application is exactly the same as for the XML version

---

## Exercise 3

* Annotate the two service classes and the calculation class so that the application functions.
* Consider what annotation to use in each case.

---

## Exercise 3 - Walkthrough

Let's modify the previous version using spring's component scanning mechanism (annotations) [^6]

[^6]: ./exercies/exercise3/

---

## What is the difference between the annotations

@Component - the basic spring bean marker. This is what component scanner is looking for

@Service - a special case of Component - used to state that this is a bean used in the service layer - there is no functional difference to Component

@Repository - also a special case of Component - but it has an extra job - to catch any persistence specific exception and to re-throw it as a standard spring exception. Requires an instance of PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor bean in the context [^6.1].

[^6.1]: Spring Boot adds this for you automatically

---

## Notes

These examples are very simple. some other things we need to consider are

* bean scopes (is it a singleton? etc)
* qualifiers (requiring a bean and there are multiple implementations available)

## Problems

* Still a lot of boiler plate
* Managing dependencies in a larger project is still challenging
  
---

# Spring Boot

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
> We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
-- Spring.io [^7]

[^7]: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/

---

Spring Boot tries to simplify:

* Setup
* Dependency Management
* Configuration

---

## Spring Boot Starters

Spring Boot provides different starters - so that you can add support for different functionality.

We'll take a look at what's available after we've looked at the same test app in a Spring Boot version.

---

## Exercise 4

See README in the exercise directory.

---

## Exercise 4 - Walkthrough

* Classes keep the same annotations as before
* Main class gets annotated `@SpringBootApplication`
* Implement the CommandLineRunner as it is a command line app [^8]

[^8]: ./exercises/exercise4/

---

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class  Application implements CommandLineRunner {
  private final ApplicationContext context;

  public Application(ApplicationContext context) {
    this.context = context;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }

  @Override
  public void run(String... args) {
    Calculation calculation = context.getBean(Calculation.class);
    
    calculation.complexCalculation();
  }
}
```

---

# Common context issues

---

Spring complains if it cannot build a valid context

Usually it will be one of two issues:

* Cannot find a bean it needs
* Finds more than one match

---

## How to fix

First - dig down through the stack trace - spring will try and tell you what it didn't manage to do.

Things to remember:

* Missing annotation on a @Component or @Service or similar?
* Missing configuration or auto configuration?
* Search by type (interface) or name can give more than one hit - can you use @Qualifier?
* Component scanning also scans dependencies (if the package name is correct)
  * did you get more than you bargained for?
  * did something that was included expect certain dependencies that are not available?
  
---

# More on Spring Beans

Spring beans have a scope which defines lifecycle

* singleton (default)
* prototype

Spring web-aware only

* request
* session
* application
* websocket

---

## Singleton bean

The standard spring bean.

The spring container will always return the same bean.

## Prototype bean

The spring container will return a new instance every time.

---

## Web aware

Lifetime of web aware beans

* request - single http request
* session - http session
* websocket - a websocket
* application - servlet context

---

# Spring Boot Configuration

Spring boot has a flexible approach to loading configuration properties.

For this course we will use the default application.properties file that spring initializr generates for us and simple use of @Value

You may wish to read up on:

* properties
* yaml
* @Configuration and @ConfigurationProperties 
* @PropertySource
* Profiles

---

## Using property values

Simplest with @Value injection

```java
@Value( "${config.property.name}" )
private String configProperty;
```

---

### Example

Let's add a property to exercise 3:

application.properties:

```
calculation.heading=Calculation Result:
```

---

Inject into Calculation and send to display:

```java
  public Calculation(Calculator calculator,
                     Display display,
                     @Value("${calculation.heading}") String heading) {
    this.calculator = calculator;
    this.display = display;
    this.heading = heading;
  }

  public void complexCalculation() {
    int result = calculator.plus(2, 3);

    this.display.output(this.heading);
    this.display.output(String.format("2 + 3 = %d", result));
  }
```
---

# Spring Boot MVC

* Resources
* Requests/sessions
* Responses

Add the web starter:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

## Resources

### Get all items

```java
@RestController
public class ExampleController {
    private final SomeService service;

    public ExampleController(SomeService service) {
      this.service = service;
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    @ResponseBody
    public List<Example> getAllExamples() {
        return service.examples();
    }
}
```

---

### PathVariable

`GET /3`

```java
@GetMapping("/{id}")
@ResponseBody
public Example getExample(@PathVariable Integer id) {
    return service.example(id);
}
```

---

### RequestParam

`GET /?id=3`

```java
@GetMapping("/")
@ResponseBody
public Example getExample(@RequestParam Integer id) {
    return service.example(id);
}
```

RequestParam can also retrieve from form posts and file uploads

---

### RequestBody

```java
@PostMapping("/")
@ResponseBody
public Example addExample(@RequestBody Example example) {
    return service.addExample(example);
}
```

---

## Exercise 5

See README in the exercise directory.

## Exercise 5 - Walkthrough

Let's take a look at an example project.[^9]

This time in kotlin with gradle using the kotlin DSL - just for fun.

Initially created with spring initializer by choosing kotlin and gradle on https://start.spring.io/
